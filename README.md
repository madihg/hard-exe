## About

hard.exe is an AI poetry interface built with the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) and GPT 4.1, as part of an exhibition by [Halim Madi](https://www.halimmadi.com). This project explores the boundaries of computational creativity, channeling the visionary power of major English-language poets and the most innovative voices of the last 30 years.
